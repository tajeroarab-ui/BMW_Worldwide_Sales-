# ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze BMWâ€™s global and regional sales performance from 2010 to 2024, identify demand trends, assess market drivers, and extract actionable insights for strategic planning, forecasting, and business optimization.
#  Analyses & Questions
## Q.1 How have BMWâ€™s total sales evolved from 2010 to 2024?
## Q.2 Which countries or regions contribute most to total sales?
## Q.3 Are there emerging markets showing rapid sales growth?
## Q.4 How has the demand for electric/hybrid models evolved since 2015?
# Key Insights
- The line shows relatively stable totals with modest year-to-year variation across the 2010â€“2024
- the contributions are tightly clustered among the major regions, with Asia edging out the others, followed closely by Europe and North America
- The fastest recent compound growth is concentrated in a couple of regions at the top of the ranking. However, none of the regions posted positive YoY in all of the last three years, suggesting volatility even among the faster growers.
  * Electric + Hybrid combined have held roughly half of total sales since 2015 in this dataset, with modest YoY fluctuations.
  * The powertrain mix chart shows a relatively balanced shift between ICE and E/H categories rather than a sudden takeover.
